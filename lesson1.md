### Intro or fun with Node
  As a programmer, or computer nerd whichever you prefer, your job is largely to tell the computer how to do things
for you because of the efforts of many programmers before you javascript already can interpret and understand a lot of
commands and has a lot of functionality. Your job will be taking what has already been laid out before you and solving
your own problems or employers problems(the problems that pay).

## Math
  Who wants to do math? You shouldn't have to make the computer do it for you try typing in '1 + 1'. Yes now you see
the magic but your computer is smarter than that throw some multiplication at it but how?

# Negate with '-'
Try these:
-1098
-2

# Decimals with '.'
Try these:
1.8
3.14

# Addition '+' and Subtraction '-'
Try these:
35 + 46
7 - 4
37 - 100

# Multiplication '*' and Division '/'
Try these:
45 * 62
8/9
9/3
4.3 * 7

# Powers '**' and Remainders '%'
Try these:
2 ** 3
73 % 9

# Bring it all together with Algebra
Try these:
2*(3-9)/8


### Data types 1
  Javascript programmers often have to do a lot more than simple math. Where the real fun comes in is with data types.
The following will not make you an expert but it will give you an overview of the meat and potatoes of Javascript (JS).

## Strings
  A string is text wrapped in quotations like "" or ''. You can do some pretty neat things with Strings but its best
just to see a little for yourself.

Try these:
"Batman"
'Batman'
`Batman`

  The third `Batman` is a little different than the others and allows us to do some pretty cool stuff that we can get
into later. What can you do with this text well quite a lot.

# Addition
Try these: 
'Batman' + ' the greatest SUPERhero'
'Batman' + 2
'Batman' + ' + ' + '2' + ' coupons' + ' a great deal'

  There are a ton of more things you can do with Strings. Its just important to know that Strings are what we use to
represent words and text to a computer. Maybe you have noticed already but if you forget the quotations then you will
get an error. Syntax is important, next up will be something a little harder to grasp.

## Variables
  Variables are like a magical box your computer uses to store data. Variables can be numbers, strings or even the
result of an expression. Variables in Javascript can store a whole lot of things but to keep with this sort of
simplistic approach we'll just talk about the things we've learned so far. There are a few keywords that are used to
create variables. We have 'var', 'const' and let. I'll be diving further into those. I just want to make sure that you've done something more computery before this lesson comes to a close. 

# Creating a variable
  In order to create a variable we will start of with the keyword 'var'. Following var we will put the name of the
variable and thats all you need to do. You can still follow that up by doing what we call 'intializing' the variable
which simply means giving the variable a value to start out with.

Try these:
var foo
var number = 1
var superhero = 'Batman'

**Something different happened just now when before you typed a string it would respond with the strings value or a
mathematical equation it would respond with the answer. Now it just says 'undefined' however if you type the name of the variable again such as foo, number or superhero. It will return the value the variable contains.

# Using variables
Lets initialize some variables:
var number = 1
var number2 = 63
var number3 = -8
var number4 = 3

These variables holding numbers can be used in place of the number they hold so number2 + number3 would give you 55.
feel free to play around with these variables containing numbers and use them with the different arithmetic
operators(+, -, *, /, %). 

You can also use a variable to contain the result of arithmetic between variables. 

Try this:
var number5 = number2 ** number4

number5 will be this wacky number:
250047

  You can use variables to store strings as well for example:

var cat = 'Siamese'

  You can do anything with a variable containing a string that you can do with a string by itself. The beauty of 
variables is that now things are saved for use later.
