#### Javascript-Tutorial
A crash course into understanding javascript as well as just basic coding ideas.

### Who is this for?
  I often have people reach out to me with interest in programming. I have actually promised to teach a few people and
this is to you. This is not for programmers but for people who want to take that first step so with out further ado.

### How to begin
  Pick your favorite terminal. If you are a Windows user like me this would be cmd. Linux has Bash and Mac has whatever
they call it ('Terminal' you guys have it simple). Type 'node' and boom there you have it. All you need to follow
along from here. Please type the things I talk about into node or rather after this '>' symbol and press enter when
you want node to evaluate.
